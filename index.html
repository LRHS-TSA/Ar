            <h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
            <p>
                Augmented Reality, or AR, is a technology that projects digital imagery and sound into the real world and modifies our perception of it. Most AR technology encountered usually includes a camera and a range of other sensors to pick up sensory information
                that triggers a change in what is seen in the real world. AR has the potential to, and has begun already to, improve many different environments that humans interact with on a regular basis. By layering computer generated graphics on that
                environment, AR adds a new perspective to places. Commercial, recreational, educational, healthcare, and military related uses are just five examples of the different uses that augmented reality takes advantage of in improving environments.

                <h1>What are the different types of Augmented Reality?</h1>
                <p>
                    The first type of AR technology is location-based AR. Location-based AR is backed by the availability of smartphones. For this type of AR location is tracked to provide information or animations for the particular location. Another type of AR is recognition-based.
                    It recognizes an object and activates a response. Most types of AR use recognition systems, excluding location-based AR. What use for recognition-based AR is to provide information about a particular object or place. It can also replace
                    or change a piece of the visual world. A common use that most are familiar with is translating words quickly. Using applications on a phone, words can change right on the screen. Another use is for architects and animators, they can
                    use three-dimensional applications to plan and create without having to actually create a model.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="not-fullscreen background parallax" style="background-image:  url('img/ar2.jpg')" data-img-width="1920" data-img-height="1080" data-diff="100"></div>
            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    The third type of AR technology is projection-based AR. It projects the imagery onto a three-dimensional object or scene. One way to do this is through projecting light onto a surface, by touching this surface and going through other reactions a response
                    is generated. Many implementations of AR technology are noninteractive and meant for a visual interaction rather than a physical interaction. An additional type of AR is superimposition. An example of this type is for a doctor to place
                    an x-ray over a patient’s body. Another use is through history, superimposition can overlay an older version of a place or object on the current version. Additionally, it can be used as an educational tool. For example, to project
                    a bone structure on an arm. The last type of AR technology is outlining AR. Outlining AR can help the human eye surpass its limitations. As the name suggests, this type of AR outlines objects to make them more clearly visible. Recognition
                    AR provides support for this AR category, like many other kinds of AR. By using this recognition a road can be outlined to show where to go in a fog or a building can be outlined to show framework and history.

                <h1>Safety and Privacy Concerns of Augmented Reality</h1>
                <p>
                    Concerns in the United States and other countries today often relate to safety and privacy. Augmented reality, while giving a boost to the technology industry, also causes some safety and privacy concerns in relation to multiple different fields. These
                    issues include giving away user's location, data on the device, and more. An example of an augmented reality app is Pokémon Go. The app utilizes the user's surrounding environment and inserts digital Pokémon which players can capture.
                    The only way to find Pokémon is to explore, so the players must walk around outside in order to be successful. According to the Chicago Tribune, there have been multiple incidents concerning robberies that were almost completely caused
                    by Pokemon Go. Players were lured into alleys and places that were not easily visible and then were robbed at gunpoint by criminals waiting for them there. Criminals also waited after dark at places where players come to receive in-game
                    items, called Pokestops, to rob users playing later at night.
                </p>

            <div class="not-fullscreen background parallax" style="background-image:  url('img/ar4.jpg')" data-img-width="818" data-img-height="453" data-diff="100"></div>
            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    Most augmented reality apps utilize the device’s camera. Upon being downloaded, they will request access to the device’s camera. When an app has this access, it can use it whenever it wants, provided the device is on. Malicious apps disguised as harmless
                    could use the camera to take pictures of the user and their surroundings without them knowing, or have access previously taken photos. Also, hackers could use the app as a means of entry to potentially take those images. The malicious
                    user receiving those photos could use them to determine where the users are, as well as determine the physical characteristics of the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the amount of control that the system maker holds, different outcomes will result. If the user is unable to clear data and the maker has complete control over the data once it is submitted, then an issue is created. Most of the concerns derived
                    from augmented reality relate to or are the same as those with any kind of technology. For the most part, settings can be changed to protect safety when using technology, but problems will always be found.

                <p>
                    In the field of augmented reality, there is a lot of potential for businesses to utilize the technology within their infrastructure and commercial fields that have yet to be properly explored. Several ways for businesses to utilize augmented reality have
                    already been idealized in the retailing field and the gaming industry. Online shopping frequency has been going up ever since the start of the 21st century. In the modern day, with technological advances increasing, producers need
                    to think of how to advertise and sell their product more efficiently. Relator brainstorming teams idealized a brand awareness system that can connect to a phone’s network via a cloud-based board. Another idea includes furniture shopping
                    in which a consumer can point their mobile device camera at an empty space in their house to see exactly how the couch or recliner seat would look.

            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    Some companies that are involved in the gaming industry have already begun to use augmented reality. These games, to little surprise have been a great success. The reason that the games are so successful is because augmented reality works best in a controlled
                    environment. For example, a controlled environment may be in a bedroom and living room which is where playing video games usually takes place. This idea has been used by several game developers that made the game The Eye of Judgement
                    where the console’s eye allowed 2-D characters on playing cards to be projected onto a TV as 3-D characters via augmented reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, there have already been several successful businesses who specialize in infrastructure and in the gaming field that have made a huge impact on the way that Augmented Reality will be implemented into the world. Furthermore, it can be expected
                    that small businesses and companies will implement Augmented Reality into their work in hopes of becoming like the world sensation Pokemon Go. With this in mind, it is important for these businesses to keep experimenting with the amazing
                    technology.

                <h1>Pros and Cons of Augmented Reality in Commercial and Recreational</h1>
                <p>
                    Augmented Reality is becoming increasingly more popular. Currently, the technology has spread to homes however, businesses are starting to recognize what they can use augmented reality for. With this, there are some benefits and some downfalls of using
                    the technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such benefits include making the workload easier to handle, using it to find or locate certain objects and areas, and provide real-time feedback for analysis of the company’s data. When companies start utilizing augmented reality, there are countless
                    possibilities of what could happen. Augmented reality can help companies with real time feedback by providing instant results and analysis of given data. This will enable more sophisticated feedback to trainees while they are doing
                    their job. This will in turn increase efficiency for the company. For example, if a company sent out their ideas for a new product in an app that utilizes augmented reality, then the users can instantly view the product, rate it, and
                    submit any questions and comments about the product.

            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    On the contrary, some downfalls of companies using augmented technology are that the company’s personal information could be at risk, invasion of privacy could take place, and it would be difficult to recognize what is reality and what is fake. It has
                    yet to be discovered of a way to determine what is real and what is fake when dealing with augmented reality, the same thing also applies to invasion of personal information. In the future, one could only hope that there will be a
                    security feature to all apps related to augmented reality.

                    There are many different uses of augmented reality (AR) for educational purposes, in and out of the classroom. Through AR implementation in educational areas, people will be engaged and more interested in learning about history, science, and more. A recently
                    unveiled 3D app for smartphones or tablets, called 1600 allows users to explore of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with just a one dollar bill. The app created by the White House lets the user “fly” through the White House and see major events,
                    like the Annual Easter Egg Roll, happen right in front of them. This animated interactive app gives people an opportunity to experience the White House and learn in the process, although it will not give an actual security clearance.

                <p>
                    Another application that is available for for learning purposes utilizes recognition-based AR for a lesson anatomy. The app, Anatomy 4-D, scans and recognizes a paper including an outline of a body with descriptions about different parts. This triggers
                    a three dimensional version of the muscular system, nervous system, skeletal system or other systems in the human body one at a time or together off of the piece of paper that can be printed right in the classroom. By rotating the
                    paper or moving the camera of the student’s device, the student is able to see the human body from different angles. Overall, augmented reality will improve the way people learn. From helping people understand to helping people get
                    interested to learn.

                    AR has many prospects for being used in education. However, it comes with a few downsides. AR offers the ability for students to see things in a new way, something that greatly benefits visual learners. Many programs allow teachers to create custom effects
                    suited for their lessons, such as Aurasma Studio. However, these are often limited. There are also programs with professionally made content, including Anatomy 4D. It allows students to use an app on their mobile device to view 3D
                    models of different organs by scanning downloadable posters. The advantage to these programs is that they are easily available via mobile devices, yet are limited by the hardware of the phone, and could be considered inferior due to
                    requiring the user to view it through a camera.

            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    However, there are also options for education programs on dedicated AR devices. HoloAnatomy works is a similar program to Anatomy 4D, built for the Microsoft HoloLens. It can project detailed 3d models of the human anatomy anywhere. The use of such tools
                    can benefit education in a way nothing else could ever before. There is however one factor holding programs such as HoloAnatomy back, cost. While the final price is unknown, and it is likely for Microsoft to offer educational discounts,
                    developmental versions of the Hololens still cost around $3,000. Even with Microsoft’s educational discounts, poorer schools will not be able to afford to purchase these tools for the classroom, restricting them to schools with larger
                    budgets. Even still, there are ways for these schools to use AR, using some of the free programs such Anatomy 4D.

                    Defibrillators are typically located in high visibility and high traffic areas. However, it is not always easy to find one. To fix this problem, Lucien Engelen from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre created an app that is downloadable to any
                    mobile device and can locate the closest AED or defibrillators. So far, the app has only been released in European countries, but it can be expected that a similar technology will be introduced to the states. The application has a
                    “results found” feature and the ability to access the device's camera and show exactly where a defibrillator would be located.

                    Patients often have a hard time describing their symptoms to their doctors with good accuracy. Sometimes, the patients over react when it comes to a medical situation, and possibly even underreact. There is an app that can help patients actually describe
                    symptoms accurately. It uses a camera display to simulate the vision of the patient who has the specific conditions. The name of the app is EyeDecide. The application uses a camera for simulating what symptoms the patient is experiencing.

                    A new company that’s sole purpose is to help doctors and nurses to locate the vein while completing an intravenous injection and pierce the vein accurately. AccuVein, a company that has increasingly become more and more popular, stated that 40% of all
                    intravenous injections miss the vein on the first try. The marketing specialist, Vinny Luciano, estimated that on more than 10 million patients, finding the vein on the first stick is 3.5x more likely with the new technology. It can
                    be expected that any patient that gets prescription drugs from their pharmacy company does not take enough time to read the labels on the side of the container. With the assistance of augmented reality, the user of the drugs can see
                    how the medicine works in 3D.

                <p>
                    Augmented reality, AR, is giving the medical field a great advantage. New AR technologies are providing the medical field with an edge, allowing doctors such as surgeons, nurses, and pediatricians to advance their techniques, as well giving tools to ordinary
                    civilians to improve their help with their healthcare.

            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    For doctors, tools like Accuvein can help increase accuracy when administering shots, by helping them locate the vein with a projection. This technology could be applied to surgeries as well, although the delicacy of surgery would require the technology
                    to be incredibly accurate, so there would be no risk of the patient being harmed. Furthermore, there are downsides to current technology, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, that could inhibit a surgery. The HoloLens’ tint might make an
                    operation more difficult to see. On top of that, it doesn’t offer much protection more bodily fluids that may splash during an operation; normally the surgeon would be using safety goggles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, medical education can further be augmented with AR, allowing students to see models of the human body in front of them. This is a massive improvement over the abstract textbooks and static models currently being used. Although the HoloLens has a
                    very limited field of view that it can display. Along with that, the cost of the AR hardware may restrict this example to top of the line medical schools.

                <h1>Potential Uses for Augmented Reality in the Military</h1>
                <p>
                    Augmented Reality can benefit any country's military in a multitude of ways. These ways include enhancing training programs, being able to give orders with less difficulties by providing visual images rather than by radio, and augmented reality can provide
                    helpful Heads Up Display (HUD)s that can assist combat pilots. Any military company can become more and more efficient in their work when using augmented reality. Through augmented reality training programs can be enhanced. By using
                    AR, trainees can become gradually better as they work with the program. By the time the trainees complete the program, they will be well on their way to being successful in the field.
                </p>

            <div class="not-fullscreen background parallax" style="background-image:  url('img/military2.jpg')" data-img-width="1920" data-img-height="1278" data-diff="100"></div>
            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    The recent communications that the military have been using for the last decade have been exceedingly inefficient. Talking over radios or walkie talkies isn’t doing the job that they need. Using assets of augmented reality, this burden will be no more.
                    It can be expected that in the future, soldiers will be able to put on some sort of headgear that shows them any necessary information. Aviation combat pilots are in desperate need of a tool that can help them know their exact coordinates,
                    their enemy’s coordinates, and any other information that they might need. Using Augmented Reality technology, and team of fighter pilots can see where their allies or opponents are. It can also give information over a Heads Up Display
                    (HUD) saying the exact location of where to drop supplies with great accuracy.

                <h1>Pros and Cons of Augmented Reality in the Military</h1>
                <p>
                    The potential uses of Augmented Reality (AR) in the military can bring some significant advantages to a country’s military. However, there can be many cons associated with AR and its usage. A term often referred to in combat is the “fog of war,” a term
                    which describes the uncertainty of a soldier’s situational awareness. Situational awareness is defined as how much a person knows of their surroundings and the events currently taking place. By using AR to display information to a
                    soldier in a Heads-Up-Display (HUD), they will have increased situational awareness which can help alleviate the fog of war effect. However, the con to this is that displaying too much information can lead to the opposite of what is
                    intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another advantage that comes with using AR is its use with dismounted warfighters. These grounded soldiers often cannot distinguish physical objects hidden from view, but AR can change that. Using a head-mounted display to create a HUD that can be used
                    to display these hidden objects. Although, using this display can severely limit a soldier's peripheral vision. To counteract this, development has been done a see-through display. The downside to the see-through display is that it
                    requires a fair amount of brightness on screen to be used outside, which requires more energy.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="not-fullscreen background parallax" style="background-image:  url('img/military4.jpg')" data-img-width="1920" data-img-height="1280" data-diff="100"></div>
            <div class="my-3">
                <p>
                    Finally, using AR for training can yield benefits that come with cost. AR gives the power to render objects not in the real world for a trainee, for example, enemy forces. The downside is that the system is limited by the rendering power of the computer.
                    For true immersion, the system would need to know the light of the surrounding environment to properly render enemies. Also, the system must be able to properly recognize obstacles that a human would not be able to pass through, otherwise
                    enemy force would run through walls. Despite all this, AR training offers a powerful new way for soldiers to practice in physical environments.
