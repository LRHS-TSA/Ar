      <h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
      <p>Augmented Reality, or AR, is a technology that projects digital imagery and sound into the real world and modifies our perception of it. Most AR technology encountered usually includes a camera and a range of other sensors to pick up sensory information that triggers a change in what is seen in the real world. AR has the potential to, and has begun already to, improve many different environments that humans interact with on a regular basis. By layering computer generated graphics on that environment, AR adds a new perspective to places. Commercial, recreational, educational, healthcare, and military related uses are just five examples of the different uses that augmented reality takes advantage of in improving environments.</p>

      <h1>How AR can change the world.</h1>
      <p>Augmented Reality is an ever growing technology. It benefits everyone and everything, because while this tech advances so does the world. People’s lives begin to become simpler and easier, but it’s not just narrowed down to the needs that regular humans have everyday. Games have been developed, in which players get to utilize tools they may not have access to in real life.</p>
      <p>An example of an Augmented Reality game that gives players a new perspective on the environment around them is Pokémon Go. The app utilizes the user's surrounding environment and inserts digital Pokémon which players can capture. The only way to find Pokémon is to explore, so the players must walk around outside in order to be successful. Another game called Fragments developed by Microsoft HoloLens is different, however. The game does not require users to perform as much digital activity, but instead has them walk around a the room they are in and examine a crime scene. The game lets the players interact with the objects and solve the case. The Microsoft HoloLens is a huge breakthrough in the AR world, as the device resembles glasses and makes the user’s experience worthwhile. According to Mark Hachman, a senior editor at PCWorld, and David Dedeine, an overseer of the HoloLens development, “the HoloLens can actually scan in a very large physical area, or “playspace”: 64 square meters, or about 680 square feet, though the number of objects in the scene will probably be taken into account. The smallest playspace is 3 square meters, he said.” This means the HoloLens can be played almost anywhere, allowing the users to play wherever they want. The same company that developed Pokémon Go, Niantic Incorporated, also developed a mobile game called Ingress. Ingress is a massive multiplayer game that uses location-based features to allow players to engage each other and fight for control of “portals”.</p>

    <p class="my-3">In school, students often do not get the chance to explore the details of some aspects of their education entirely. In their history class, they may not get to look at Egyptian temples or see real life gladiator costumes. Augmented Reality can fix that. Through this advanced technology, students will be able to view full scale Egyptian temple. They can also view themselves in full Roman Centurion armor. The AR’s computer generated layer graphics will enable the students to then interact with each piece of armor and find out how each specific piece works. Stated by <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-02-how-to-transform-your-classroom-with-augmented-reality">Patricia Brown</a>, Popar Toys is a developer that specializes in making toys with Augmented Reality. They have products such as charts, puzzles, and picture books, all in which the images come alive to enhance the children’s ability to learn the material. Children can study U.S. Presidents, state capitals, human anatomy, the periodic table of elements, space, and animals. All user’s have to do is scan the Popar graphic with the PlayAR mobile device app. Another developer is Quiver, where students can learn about almost anything, especially the natural sciences, through an app-activated animated coloring book. It’s learning made easy for everyone!</p>

    <p class="my-3">The commercial world will no doubt benefit greatly from the improvements in the Augmented Reality industry. As stated by The App Solutions, the technological progress in AR/VR educational and gaming uses, as well as conducting research and creating more jobs, is estimated to make around $150 billion by the year 2020, with AR making $120 billion. The AR amount is superior to the unproportional $30 billion being made by Virtual Reality. CrowdOpticsTM  is a company that develops wearable AR technology that lets employees analyze objects in the business and medical field. For instance, healthcare professionals such as sports medicine doctors can utilize CrowdOpticsTM to analyze injuries and get the help players need. Entertainment and security industries also use these wearables in their fields as well. There have been case studies in which apps have been attempted where users can enter virtual fitting rooms and find the right clothing size, see what color car they like best, and to see what furniture fits best in their homes.</p>
