and Cons of Augmented Reality in Healthcare</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Augmented
reality is giving the medical field a great advantage. New AR 
technologies are providing the medical field with an edge, allowing
doctors such as surgeons, nurses, and pediatricians to advance their
techniques, as well giving tools to ordinary civilians to improve
their help with their healthcare.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">For
doctors, tools like Accuvein can help increase accuracy when
administering shots, by helping them locate the vein with a
projection. This technology could be applied to surgeries as well,
although the delicacy of surgery would require the technology to be
incredibly accurate, so there would be no risk of the patient being
harmed. Furthermore, there are downsides to current technology, such
as the Microsoft HoloLens, that could inhibit a surgery. The
HoloLens&rsquo; tint might make an operation more difficult to see.
On top of that, it doesn&rsquo;t offer much protection more bodily
fluids that may splash during an operation; normally the surgeon
would be using safety goggles. </font></font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Also,
medical education can further be augmented with AR, allowing students
to see models of the human body in front of them. This is a massive
improvement over the abstract textbooks and static models currently
being used. Although the HoloLens has a very limited field of view
that it can display. Along with that, the cost of the AR hardware may
restrict this example to top of the line medical schools.</font></font></p>
