<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Defibrillators
are typically located in high visibility and high traffic areas.
However, it is not always easy to find one. To fix this problem,
Lucien Engelen from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre
created an app that is downloadable to any mobile device and can
locate the closest AED or defibrillators. So far, the app has only
been released in European countries, but it can be expected that a
similar technology will be introduced to the states. The application
has a &ldquo;results found&rdquo; feature and the ability to access
the device's camera and show exactly where a defibrillator would be
located.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Patients
often have a hard time describing their symptoms to their doctors
with good accuracy. Sometimes, the patients over react when it comes
to a medical situation, and possibly even underreact. There is an app
that can help patients actually describe symptoms accurately. It uses
a camera display to simulate the vision of the patient who has the
specific conditions. The name of the app is EyeDecide. The
application uses a camera for simulating what symptoms the patient is
experiencing. </font></font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
new company that&rsquo;s sole purpose is to help doctors and nurses
to locate the vein while completing an intravenous injection and
pierce the vein accurately. AccuVein, a company that has increasingly
become more and more popular, stated that 40% of all intravenous
injections miss the vein on the first try. The marketing specialist,
Vinny Luciano, estimated that on more than 10 million patients,
finding the vein on the first stick is 3.5x more likely with the new
technology.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	It
can be expected that any patient that gets prescription drugs from
their pharmacy company does not take enough time to read the labels
on the side of the container. With the assistance of augmented
reality, the user of the drugs can see how the medicine works in 3D.</font></font></p>
