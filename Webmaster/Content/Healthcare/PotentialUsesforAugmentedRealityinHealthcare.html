Augmented Reality in Healthcare</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Defibrillators are typically located
in high visibility and high traffic areas. However, it is not
always easy to find one. To fix this problem, Lucien Engelen from
Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre created an app that is
downloadable to any mobile device and can locate the closest AED or
defibrillators. So far, the app has only been released in European
countries, but it can be expected that a similar technology will be
introduced to the states. The application has a “results found”
feature and the ability to access the device's camera and show
exactly where a defibrillator would be located.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Patients often have a hard time
describing their symptoms to their doctors with good accuracy.
Sometimes, the patients over react when it comes to a medical
situation, and possibly even underreact. There is an app that can
help patients actually describe symptoms accurately. It uses a
camera display to simulate the vision of the patient who has the
specific conditions. The name of the app is EyeDecide. The
application uses a camera for simulating what symptoms the patient
is experiencing.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">A new company that’s sole purpose is
to help doctors and nurses to locate the vein while completing an
intravenous injection and pierce the vein accurately. AccuVein, a
company that has increasingly become more and more popular, stated
that 40% of all intravenous injections miss the vein on the first
try. The marketing specialist, Vinny Luciano, estimated that on
more than 10 million patients, finding the vein on the first stick
is 3.5x more likely with the new technology.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">It can be expected that any patient
that gets prescription drugs from their pharmacy company does not
take enough time to read the labels on the side of the container.
With the assistance of augmented reality, the user of the drugs can
see how the medicine works in 3D.</span></p>
