<p align="center" class="c2"><span class="c1">Pros and Cons of
Augmented Reality in Healthcare</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Augmented reality is giving the
medical field a great advantage. New AR technologies are providing
the medical field with an edge, allowing doctors such as surgeons,
nurses, and pediatricians to advance their techniques, as well
giving tools to ordinary civilians to improve their help with their
healthcare.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">For doctors, tools like Accuvein can
help increase accuracy when administering shots, by helping them
locate the vein with a projection. This technology could be applied
to surgeries as well, although the delicacy of surgery would
require the technology to be incredibly accurate, so there would be
no risk of the patient being harmed. Furthermore, there are
downsides to current technology, such as the Microsoft HoloLens,
that could inhibit a surgery. The HoloLens’ tint might make an
operation more difficult to see. On top of that, it doesn’t offer
much protection more bodily fluids that may splash during an
operation; normally the surgeon would be using safety
goggles.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Also, medical education can further
be augmented with AR, allowing students to see models of the human
body in front of them. This is a massive improvement over the
abstract textbooks and static models currently being used. Although
the HoloLens has a very limited field of view that it can display.
Along with that, the cost of the AR hardware may restrict this
example to top of the line medical schools.</span></p>
