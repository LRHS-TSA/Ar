Uses of Augmented Reality in Education?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">There are many different uses of
augmented reality (AR) for educational purposes, in and out of the
classroom. Through AR implementation in educational areas, people
will be engaged and more interested in learning about history,
science, and more.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">A recently unveiled 3D app for
smartphones or tablets, called 1600 allows users to explore of 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue with just a one dollar bill. The app created by
the White House lets the user “fly” through the White House and see
major events, like the Annual Easter Egg Roll, happen right in
front of them. This animated interactive app gives people an
opportunity to experience the White House and learn in the process,
although it will not give an actual security clearance.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Another application that is
available for for learning purposes utilizes recognition-based AR
for a lesson anatomy. The app, Anatomy 4-D, scans and recognizes a
paper including an outline of a body with descriptions about
different parts. This triggers a three dimensional version of the
muscular system, nervous system, skeletal system or other systems
in the human body one at a time or together off of the piece of
paper that can be printed right in the classroom. By rotating the
paper or moving the camera of the student’s device, the student is
able to see the human body from different angles.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Overall, augmented reality will
improve the way people learn. From helping people understand to
helping people get interested to learn.</span></p>
