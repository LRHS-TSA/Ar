are Potential Uses of Augmented Reality in Education?</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	There
are many different uses of augmented reality (AR) for educational
purposes, in and out of the classroom. Through AR implementation in
educational areas, people will be engaged and more interested in
learning about history, science, and more.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	A
recently unveiled 3D app for smartphones or tablets, called 1600
allows users to explore of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with just a one
dollar bill. The app created by the White House lets the user &ldquo;fly&rdquo;
through the White House and see major events, like the Annual Easter
Egg Roll, happen right in front of them. This animated interactive
app gives people an opportunity to experience the White House and
learn in the process, although it will not give an actual security
clearance.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another
application that is available for for learning purposes utilizes
recognition-based AR for a lesson anatomy. The app, Anatomy 4-D,
scans and recognizes a paper including an outline of a body with
descriptions about different parts. This triggers a three dimensional
version of the muscular system, nervous system, skeletal system or
other systems in the human body one at a time or together off of the
piece of paper that can be printed right in the classroom. By
rotating the paper or moving the camera of the student&rsquo;s
device, the student is able to see the human body from different
angles. </font></font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Overall,
augmented reality will improve the way people learn. From helping
people understand to helping people get interested to learn.</font></font></p>
