Augmented Reality?</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">The first type of AR technology is
location-based AR. Location-based AR is backed by the availability
of smartphones. For this type of AR location is tracked to provide
information or animations for the particular location.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Another type of AR is
recognition-based. It recognizes an object and activates a
response. Most types of AR use recognition systems, excluding
location-based AR. What use for recognition-based AR is to provide
information about a particular object or place. It can also replace
or change a piece of the visual world. A common use that most are
familiar with is translating words quickly. Using applications on a
phone, words can change right on the screen. Another use is for
architects and animators, they can use three dimensional
applications to plan and create without having to actually create a
model.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The third type of AR technology is
projection-based AR. It projects the imagery onto a three
dimensional object or scene. One way to do this is through
projecting light onto a surface, by touching this surface and going
through other reactions a response is generated. Many
implementations of AR technology are noninteractive and meant for a
visual interaction rather than a physical interaction.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">An additional type of AR is
superimposition. An example of this type is for a doctor to place
an x-ray over a patientâ€™s body. Another use is through history,
superimposition can overlay an older version of a place or object
on the current version. Additionally, it can be used as an
educational tool. For example, to project bone structure on an
arm.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The last type of AR technology is
outlining AR. The human eye has limitations and outlining AR can
help. Recognition AR provides support for this AR category, like
many other kinds of AR. By using this recognition a road can be
outlined to show where to go in a fog or a building can be outlined
to show framework and history.</span></p>
