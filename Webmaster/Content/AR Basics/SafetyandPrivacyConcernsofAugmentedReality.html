<p align="center" class="c2"><span class="c1">Safety and Privacy
Concerns of Augmented Reality</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Concerns in the United States and
other countries today often relate to safety and privacy. Augmented
reality, while giving a boost to the technology industry, also
causes some safety and privacy concerns in relation to multiple
different fields. These issues include giving away user's location,
data on the device, and more.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">An example of an augmented reality
app is Pokémon Go. The app utilizes the user's surrounding
environment and inserts digital Pokémon which players can capture.
The only way to find Pokémon is to explore, so the players must
walk around outside in order to be successful. According to the
Chicago Tribune, there have been multiple incidents concerning
robberies that were almost completely caused by Pokemon Go. Players
were lured into alleys and places that were not easily visible and
then were robbed at gunpoint by criminals waiting for them there.
Criminals also waited after dark at places where players come to
receive in-game items, called Pokestops, to rob users playing later
at night.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most augmented reality apps utilize
the device’s camera. Upon being downloaded, they will request
access to the device’s camera. When an app has this access, it can
use it whenever it wants, provided the device is on. Malicious apps
disguised as harmless could use the camera to take pictures of the
user and their surroundings without them knowing, or have access
previously taken photos. Also, hackers could use the app as a means
of entry to potentially take those images. The malicious user
receiving those photos could use them to determine where the users
are, as well as determine the physical characteristics of the
environment.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Depending on the amount of control
that the system maker holds, different outcomes will result. If the
user is unable to clear data and the maker has complete control
over the data once it is submitted, then an issue is
created.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most of the concerns derived from
augmented reality relate to or are the same as those with any kind
of technology. For the most part, settings can be changed to
protect safety when using technology, but problems will always be
found.</span></p>
