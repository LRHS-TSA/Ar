Reality?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Augmented Reality, or AR, is a
technology that projects digital imagery and sound into the real
world and modifies our perception of it. Most AR technology
encountered usually includes a camera and a range of other sensors
to pick up sensory information that triggers a change in what is
seen in the real world. AR has the potential to, and has begun
already to, improve many different environments that humans
interact with on a regular basis. By layering computer generated
graphics on that environment, AR adds a new perspective to places.
Commercial, recreational, educational, healthcare, and military
related uses are just five examples of the different uses that
augmented reality takes advantage of in improving
environments.</span></p>
