<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">What
are Types for Augmented Reality?</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
first type of AR technology is location-based AR. Location-based AR
is backed by the availability of smartphones. For this type of AR
location is tracked to provide information or animations for the
particular location. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Another
type of AR is recognition-based. It recognizes an object and
activates a response. Most types of AR use recognition systems,
excluding location-based AR. What use for recognition-based AR is to
provide information about a particular object or place. It can also
replace or change a piece of the visual world. A common use that most
are familiar with is translating words quickly. Using applications on
a phone, words can change right on the screen. Another use is for
architects and animators, they can use three dimensional applications
to plan and create without having to actually create a model.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
third type of AR technology is projection-based AR. It projects the
imagery onto a three dimensional object or scene. One way to do this
is through projecting light onto a surface, by touching this surface
and going through other reactions a response is generated. Many
implementations of AR technology are noninteractive and meant for a
visual interaction rather than a physical interaction. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	An
additional type of AR is superimposition. An example of this type is
for a doctor to place an x-ray over a patient&rsquo;s body. Another
use is through history, superimposition can overlay an older version
of a place or object on the current version. Additionally, it can be
used as an educational tool. For example, to project bone structure
on an arm.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
last type of AR technology is outlining AR. The human eye has
limitations and outlining AR can help. Recognition AR provides
support for this AR category, like many other kinds of AR. By using
this recognition a road can be outlined to show where to go in a fog
or a building can be outlined to show framework and history.</font></font></p>
