<p class="c1">Augmented Reality is an ever growing technology. It
benefits everyone and everything, because while this tech advances
so does the world. People’s lives begin to become simpler and
easier, but it’s not just narrowed down to the needs that regular
humans have everyday. Games have been developed, in which players
get to utilize tools they may not have access to in real life.</p>
<p class="c1"><br></p>
<p class="c1">An example of an Augmented Reality game that gives
players a new perspective on the environment around them is Pokémon
Go. The app utilizes the user's surrounding environment and inserts
digital Pokémon which players can capture. The only way to find
Pokémon is to explore, so the players must walk around outside in
order to be successful. Another game called Fragments developed by
Microsoft HoloLens is different, however. The game does not require
users to perform as much digital activity, but instead has them
walk around a the room they are in and examine a crime scene. The
game lets the players interact with the objects and solve the case.
The Microsoft HoloLens is a huge breakthrough in the AR world, as
the device resembles glasses and makes the user’s experience
worthwhile. According to Mark Hachman, a senior editor at PCWorld,
and David Dedeine, an overseer of the HoloLens development, “the
HoloLens can actually scan in a very large physical area, or
“playspace”: 64 square meters, or about 680 square feet, though the
number of objects in the scene will probably be taken into account.
The smallest playspace is 3 square meters, he said.” This means the
HoloLens can be played almost anywhere, allowing the users to play
wherever they want. The same company that developed Pokémon Go,
Niantic Incorporated, also developed a mobile game called Ingress.
Ingress is a massive multiplayer game that uses location-based
features to allow players to engage each other and fight for
control of “portals”.</p>

<p class="c1">In school, students often do not get the chance to
explore the details of some aspects of their education entirely. In
their history class, they may not get to look at Egyptian temples
or see real life gladiator costumes. Augmented Reality can fix
that. Through this advanced technology, students will be able to
view full scale Egyptian temple. They can also view themselves in
full Roman Centurion armor. The AR’s computer generated layer
graphics will enable the students to then interact with each piece
of armor and find out how each specific piece works. Stated by

Popar Toys is a developer that specializes in making toys with
Augmented Reality. They have products such as charts, puzzles, and
picture books, all in which the images come alive to enhance the
children’s ability to learn the material. Children can study U.S.
Presidents, state capitals, human anatomy, the periodic table of
elements, space, and animals. All user’s have to do is scan the
Popar graphic with the PlayAR mobile device app. Another developer
is Quiver, where students can learn about almost anything,
especially the natural sciences, through an app-activated animated
coloring book. It’s learning made easy for everyone!</p>

<p class="c1">The commercial world will no doubt benefit greatly
from the improvements in the Augmented Reality industry. As stated
by The App Solutions, the technological progress in AR/VR
educational and gaming uses, as well as conducting research and
creating more jobs, is estimated to make around $150 billion by the
year 2020, with AR making $120 billion. The AR amount is superior
to the unproportional $30 billion being made by Virtual Reality.
CrowdOpticsTM is a company that develops wearable AR technology
that lets employees analyze objects in the business and medical
field. For instance, healthcare professionals such as sports
medicine doctors can utilize CrowdOpticsTM to analyze injuries and
get the help players need. Entertainment and security industries
also use these wearables in their fields as well. There have been
case studies in which apps have been attempted where users can
enter virtual fitting rooms and find the right clothing size, see
what color car they like best, and to see what furniture fits best
in their homes.</p>
