<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Safety
and Privacy Concerns of Augmented Reality</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Concerns
in the United States and other countries today often relate to safety
and privacy. Augmented reality, while giving a boost to the
technology industry, also causes some safety and privacy concerns in
relation to multiple different fields. These issues include giving
away user's location, data on the device, and more. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">An
example of an augmented reality app is Pok&eacute;mon Go. The app
utilizes the user's surrounding environment and inserts digital
Pok&eacute;mon which players can capture. The only way to find
Pok&eacute;mon is to explore, so the players must walk around outside
in order to be successful. According to the Chicago Tribune, there
have been multiple incidents concerning robberies that were almost
completely caused by Pokemon Go. Players were lured into alleys and
places that were not easily visible and then were robbed at gunpoint
by criminals waiting for them there. Criminals also waited after dark
at places where players come to receive in-game items, called
Pokestops, to rob users playing later at night.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Most
augmented reality apps utilize the device&rsquo;s camera. Upon being
downloaded, they will request access to the device&rsquo;s camera.
When an app has this access, it can use it whenever it wants,
provided the device is on. Malicious apps disguised as harmless could
use the camera to take pictures of the user and their surroundings
without them knowing, or have access previously taken photos. Also,
hackers could use the app as a means of entry to potentially take
those images. The malicious user receiving those photos could use
them to determine where the users are, as well as determine the
physical characteristics of the environment. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Depending
on the amount of control that the system maker holds, different
outcomes will result. If the user is unable to clear data and the
maker has complete control over the data once it is submitted, then
an issue is created.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Most
of the concerns derived from augmented reality relate to or are the
same as those with any kind of technology. For the most part,
settings can be changed to protect safety when using technology, but
problems will always be found. </font></font>
