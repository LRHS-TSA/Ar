Augmented Reality in Commercial and Recreational</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Augmented Reality is becoming
increasingly more and more popular. Currently, the technology has
spread to homes however, businesses are starting to recognize what
they can use augmented reality for. With this, there are some
benefits and some downfalls of using the technology.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Such benefits include making the
workload easier to handle, using it to find or locate certain
objects and areas, and provide real-time feedback for analysis of
the company’s data. When companies start utilizing augmented
reality, there are countless possibilities of what could happen.
Augmented reality can help companies with real time feedback by
providing instant results and analysis of given data. This will
enable more sophisticated feedback to trainees while they are doing
their job. This will in turn increase efficiency for the company.
For example, if a company sent out their ideas for a new product in
an app that utilizes augmented reality, then the users can
instantly view the product, rate it, and submit any questions and
comments about the product.</span></p>

companies using augmented technology are that the company’s
personal information could be at risk, invasion of privacy could
take place, and it would be difficult to recognize what is reality
and what is fake. It has yet to be discovered of a way to determine
what is real and what is fake when dealing with augmented reality,
the same thing also applies to invasion of personal information. In
the future, one could only hope that there will be a security
feature to all apps related to augmented reality.</span></p>
