<p align="center" class="c2"><span class="c1">What are Potential
Uses of Augmented Reality in Commercial and
Recreational?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">In the field of augmented reality,
there is a lot of potential for businesses to utilize the
technology within their infrastructure and commercial fields that
have yet to be properly explored. Several ways for businesses to
utilize augmented reality have already been idealized in the
retailing field and the gaming industry.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Online shopping frequency has been
going up ever since the start of the 21st century. In the modern
day, with technological advances increasing, producers need to
think of how to advertise and sell their product more efficiently.
Relator brainstorming teams idealized a brand awareness system that
can connect to a phone’s network via a cloud-based board. Another
idea includes furniture shopping in which a consumer can point
their mobile device camera at an empty space in their house to see
exactly how the couch or recliner seat would look.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Some companies that are involved in
the gaming industry have already begun to use augmented reality.
These games, to little surprise have been a great success. The
reason that the games are so successful is because augmented
reality works best in a controlled environment. For example, a
controlled environment may be in a bedroom and living room which is
where playing video games usually takes place. This idea has been
used by several game developers that made the game</span>
<span class="c4">The Eye of Judgement</span><span class="c3">where
the console’s eye allowed 2-D characters on playing cards to be
projected onto a TV as 3-D characters via augmented
reality.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">In conclusion, there have already
been several successful businesses who specialize in infrastructure
and in the gaming field that have made a huge impact on the way
that Augmented Reality will be implemented into the world.
Furthermore, it can be expected that small businesses and companies
will implement Augmented Reality into their work in hopes of
becoming like the world sensation</span> <span class="c4">Pokemon
Go</span><span class="c3">. With this in mind, it is important for
these businesses to keep experimenting with the amazing
technology.</span></p>
