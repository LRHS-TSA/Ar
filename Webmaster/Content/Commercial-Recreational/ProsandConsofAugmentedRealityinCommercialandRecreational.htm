and Cons of Augmented Reality in Commercial and Recreational</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Augmented
Reality is becoming increasingly more and more popular. Currently,
the technology has spread to homes however, businesses are starting
to recognize what they can use augmented reality for. With this,
there are some benefits and some downfalls of using the technology. </font></font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Such
benefits include making the workload easier to handle, using it to
find or locate certain objects and areas, and provide real-time
feedback for analysis of the company&rsquo;s data. When companies
start utilizing augmented reality, there are countless possibilities
of what could happen. Augmented reality can help companies with real
time feedback by providing instant results and analysis of given
data. This will enable more sophisticated feedback to trainees while
they are doing their job. This will in turn increase efficiency for
the company. For example, if a company sent out their ideas for a new
product in an app that utilizes augmented reality, then the users can
instantly view the product, rate it, and submit any questions and
comments about the product.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">On
the contrary, some downfalls of companies using augmented technology
are that the company&rsquo;s personal information could be at risk,
invasion of privacy could take place, and it would be difficult to
recognize what is reality and what is fake. It has yet to be
discovered of a way to determine what is real and what is fake when
dealing with augmented reality, the same thing also applies to
invasion of personal information. In the future, one could only hope
that there will be a security feature to all apps related to
augmented reality.</font></font></p>
