are Potential Uses of Augmented Reality in Commercial and
Recreational?</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
the field of augmented reality, there is a lot of potential for
businesses to utilize the technology within their infrastructure and
commercial fields that have yet to be properly explored. Several ways
for businesses to utilize augmented reality have already been
idealized in the retailing field and the gaming industry. </font></font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Online
shopping frequency has been going up ever since the start of the 21st
century. In the modern day, with technological advances increasing,
producers need to think of how to advertise and sell their product
more efficiently. Relator brainstorming teams idealized a brand
awareness system that can connect to a phone&rsquo;s network via a
cloud-based board. Another idea includes furniture shopping in which
a consumer can point their mobile device camera at an empty space in
their house to see exactly how the couch or recliner seat would look.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Some
companies that are involved in the gaming industry have already begun
to use augmented reality. These games, to little surprise have been a
great success. The reason that the games are so successful is because
augmented reality works best in a controlled environment. For
example, a controlled environment may be in a bedroom and living room
which is where playing video games usually takes place. This idea has
been used by several game developers that made the game </font></font><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>The
Eye of Judgement</i></font></font><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
where the console&rsquo;s eye allowed 2-D characters on playing cards
to be projected onto a TV as 3-D characters via augmented reality.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
conclusion, there have already been several successful businesses who
specialize in infrastructure and in the gaming field that have made a
huge impact on the way that Augmented Reality will be implemented
into the world. Furthermore, it can be expected that small businesses
and companies will implement Augmented Reality into their work in
hopes of becoming like the world sensation </font></font><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>Pokemon

With this in mind, it is important for these businesses to keep
experimenting with the amazing technology.</font></font></p>
