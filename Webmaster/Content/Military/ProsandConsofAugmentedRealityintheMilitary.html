Augmented Reality in the Military</span></p>
<p align="center" class="c2"><br></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">The potential uses of Augmented
Reality (AR) in the military can bring some significant advantages
to a country’s military. However, there can be many cons associated
with AR and its usage. A term often referred to in combat is the
“fog of war,” a term which describes the uncertainty of a soldier’s
situational awareness. Situational awareness is defined as how much
a person knows of their surroundings and the events currently
taking place. By using AR to display information to a soldier in a
Heads-Up-Display (HUD), they will have increased situational
awareness which can help alleviate the fog of war effect. However,
the con to this is that displaying too much information can lead to
the opposite of what is intended.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Another advantage that comes with
using AR is its use with dismounted warfighters. These grounded
soldiers often cannot distinguish physical objects hidden from
view, but AR can change that. Using a head-mounted display to
create a HUD that can be used to display these hidden objects.
Although, using this display can severely limit a soldier's
peripheral vision. To counteract this, development has been done a
see-through display. The downside to the see-through display is
that it requires a fair amount of brightness on screen to be used
outside, which requires more energy.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Finally, using AR for training can
yield benefits that come with cost. AR gives the power to render
objects not in the real world for a trainee, for example, enemy
forces. The downside is that the system is limited by the rendering
power of the computer. For true immersion, the system would need to
know the light of the surrounding environment to properly render
enemies. Also, the system must be able to properly recognize
obstacles that a human would not be able to pass through, otherwise
enemy force would run through walls. Despite all this, AR training
offers a powerful new way for soldiers to practice in physical
environments.</span></p>
