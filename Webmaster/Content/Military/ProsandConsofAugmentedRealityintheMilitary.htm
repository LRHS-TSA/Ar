<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
potential uses of Augmented Reality (AR) in the military can bring
some significant advantages to a country&rsquo;s military. However,
there can be many cons associated with AR and its usage. A term often
referred to in combat is the &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; a term which
describes the uncertainty of a soldier&rsquo;s situational awareness.
Situational awareness is defined as how much a person knows of their
surroundings and the events currently taking place. By using AR to
display information to a soldier in a Heads-Up-Display (HUD), they
will have increased situational awareness which can help alleviate
the fog of war effect. However, the con to this is that displaying
too much information can lead to the opposite of what is intended. </font></font>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Another
advantage that comes with using AR is its use with dismounted
warfighters. These grounded soldiers often cannot distinguish
physical objects hidden from view, but AR can change that. Using a
head-mounted display to create a HUD that can be used to display
these hidden objects. Although, using this display can severely limit
a soldier's peripheral vision. To counteract this, development has
been done a see-through display. The downside to the see-through
display is that it requires a fair amount of brightness on screen to
be used outside, which requires more energy.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Finally,
using AR for training can yield benefits that come with cost. AR
gives the power to render objects not in the real world for a
trainee, for example, enemy forces. The downside is that the system
is limited by the rendering power of the computer. For true
immersion, the system would need to know the light of the surrounding
environment to properly render enemies. Also, the system must be able
to properly recognize obstacles that a human would not be able to
pass through, otherwise enemy force would run through walls. Despite
all this, AR training offers a powerful new  way for soldiers to
practice in physical environments.</font></font></p>
