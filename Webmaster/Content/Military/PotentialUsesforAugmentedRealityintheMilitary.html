<p align="center" class="c2"><span class="c1">Potential Uses for
Augmented Reality in the Military</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Augmented Reality can benefit any
country's military in a multitude of ways. These ways include
enhancing training programs, being able to give orders with less
difficulties by providing visual images rather than by radio, and
augmented reality can provide helpful Heads Up Display (HUD)s that
can assist combat pilots. Any military company can become more and
more efficient in their work when using augmented
reality.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Through augmented reality training
programs can be enhanced. By using AR, trainees can become
gradually better as they work with the program. By the time the
trainees complete the program, they will be well on their way to
being successful in the field.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The recent communications that the
military have been using for the last decade have been exceedingly
inefficient. Talking over radios or walkie talkies isn’t doing the
job that they need. Using assets of augmented reality, this burden
will be no more. It can be expected that in the future, soldiers
will be able to put on some sort of headgear that shows them any
necessary information.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c3">Aviation combat pilots are in
desperate need of a tool that can help them know their exact
coordinates, their enemy’s coordinates, and any other information
that they might need. Using Augmented Reality technology, and team
of fighter pilots can see where their allies or opponents are. It
can also give information over a Heads Up Display (HUD) saying the
exact location of where to drop supplies with great
accuracy.</span></p>
