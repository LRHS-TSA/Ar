<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Augmented
Reality can benefit any country's military in a multitude of ways.
These ways include enhancing training programs, being able to give
orders with less difficulties by providing visual images rather than
by radio, and augmented reality can provide helpful Heads Up Display
(HUD)s that can assist combat pilots. Any military company can become
more and more efficient in their work when using augmented reality.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Through
augmented reality training programs can be enhanced. By using AR,
trainees can become gradually better as they work with the program.
By the time the trainees complete the program, they will be well on
their way to being successful in the field.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The
recent communications that the military have been using for the last
decade have been exceedingly inefficient. Talking over radios or
walkie talkies isn&rsquo;t doing the job that they need. Using assets
of augmented reality, this burden will be no more. It can be expected
that in the future, soldiers will be able to put on some sort of
headgear that shows them any necessary information.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><font face="Proxima Nova, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Aviation
combat pilots are in desperate need of a tool that can help them know
their exact coordinates, their enemy&rsquo;s coordinates, and any
other information that they might need. Using Augmented Reality
technology, and team of fighter pilots can see where their allies or
opponents are. It can also give information over a Heads Up Display
(HUD) saying the exact location of where to drop supplies with great
accuracy.</font></font></p>
